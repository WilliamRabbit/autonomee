robot-SVGMap
============

A Python front-end for robot localization (and other uses) using SVG for the maps and Qt for the UI.
This includes a *really* basic SVG parser, some "collision" methods to calculate the distance to the closest obstacle and the visualization and movement of the robot. (And hopefully, will also contain an interface to talk to an Arduino-based robot and localize it on the map)
